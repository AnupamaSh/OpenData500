MedWatcher allows users to submit adverse event reports to the FDA using a streamlined form while providing them with real-time notifications of government safety alerts, reported adverse events, news and research, and social media activity for specified products. Endorsed and co-branded by the FDA, MedWatcher currently covers all US drugs, devices, and vaccines, with expansion into the EU in progress. 
 
Half of all Americans take a prescription drug, yet 86% of adverse drug events go unreported, according to HHS, with most reports coming from manufacturers. Reports that do get submitted are processed by the FDA and made public on an irregular basis -- monthly, quarterly, or sometimes even less frequently. This information system is slow, resulting in many missed safety signals, and puts patients at risk.
 
MedWatcher tackles this issue by making it vastly easier to report adverse events and by sharing adverse event data immediately with patient and provider communities. With direct involvement from patients, a high volume of data, and a user-friendly, transparent system, MedWatcher is a powerful tool for making drugs, devices, and vaccines safer.","MedWatcher is a user-friendly tool for tracking and reporting side effects of drugs, medical devices, and vaccines.",MedWatcher is a project out of Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

The platform functions as a marketplace helping research scientists find the expertise and services they need at other university labs, core facilities, and contract research organizations. The objective is to help improve the pace of scientific research by improving the efficiency by which researchers can search for, compare and order scientific services on an open marketplace platform.

For service providers, Science Exchange aims to increase utilization and quality recognition within an open marketplace. Service providers are government funded core facilities and university labs, which have difficulty in promoting services for external use, and tracking impact of services. Science Exchange helps researchers find the facility's services in a centralized platform, and increase utilization of labs that are running below capacity. The platform also allows for tracking of all work performed, and publications resulting from work performed on the site with collaborates - making management and reporting of service labs easier.

Overall, the goal of Science Exchange is to help scientists access the resources and expertise at university based institutions, that they otherwise could not find, afford, or access.","Science Exchange's goal is help researchers access the world's scientific expertise, advancing open science initiatives to change the pace of scientific research.","Science Exchange is a venture-backed company, started as part of Y Combinator, with funding from top VC firms including Andreessen Horowitz, O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, and Union Square Ventures.
