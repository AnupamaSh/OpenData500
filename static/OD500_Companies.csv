Personal helps give people ownership and control over their data so they can get the most value from it all with the peace of mind that the information in their vault remains legally theirs, it can't be shared without their permission, they always know who has access to it, and they can stop access at any time. Users can also export and permanently delete their data. Personal is available on the web, iOS and Google Play.","Personal (www.personal.com) provides individuals with the tools to create a private, personal network where they can control their identity and determine access to their data when connecting with people and companies.","Personalâ€™s mission of empowering individuals with their own data is one that has major impacts for society, the institutions (including government) that traditionally collect and control our data, and individuals. Both government and companies are embracing this model, which is a significant sign of impact.","To date, Personal has raised nearly $16 million in capital. Investors include Steve Caseâ€™s Revolution Ventures, Grotech Ventures, Eric Semler of TCS Capital Management, Allen & Company, Ted Leonsis, former AOL CEO Jon Miller, among others. We generate revenue through paid subscriptions and partnering with companies and organizations to distribute co-branded Personal vaults to their customers and members.

Science Exchange,scienceexchange.com,Palo Alto,California, CA,94301,Elizabeth ,Iorns,The Bench,2011,,Private,,Online Marketplace,Scientific Research,User fees for web or mobile access,"Science Exchange is an online platform seeking to provide easy access to the global network of scientific resources and expertise. The platform functions as a marketplace helping research scientists find the expertise and services they need at other university labs, core facilities, and contract research organizations. The objective is to help improve the pace of scientific research by improving the efficiency by which researchers can search for, compare and order scientific services on an open marketplace platform.

For service providers, Science Exchange aims to increase utilization and quality recognition within an open marketplace. Service providers are government funded core facilities and university labs, which have difficulty in promoting services for external use, and tracking impact of services. Science Exchange helps researchers find the facility's services in a centralized platform, and increase utilization of labs that are running below capacity. The platform also allows for tracking of all work performed, and publications resulting from work performed on the site with collaborates - making management and reporting of service labs easier.

Overall, the goal of Science Exchange is to help scientists access the resources and expertise at university based institutions, that they otherwise could not find, afford, or access.","Our goal is to make it easier for researchers to access the world's scientific expertise, advancing open science initiatives to change the pace of scientific research.","Primarily, we track the number of research collaborations formed through utilization of the online marketplace. Each order on Science Exchange is essentially a contract formed between two research scientists. This helps the researcher save grant funding as they can then access low-cost expertise at another lab, without having to order new equipment. This also helps the service labs run at capacity, as they are federally funded and required to operate at capacity. We also track research publications resulting from the collaborations on our platform, as the platform expands their scope by helping engage in larger studies otherwise not possible.","Science Exchange is a venture backed company, but one with a strong social mission open science access.

We were started as a part of the Y Combinator incubator program, and have received funding from some of the top VC firms including Andreessen Horowitz, O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, and Union Square Ventures. We strategically choose investment from firms like OATV, as they match our open access mission.

We actively collaborate, participate, and support the open science framework. We've partnered with eagle-i to improve access to government-funded resources in online directories. We've established the Reproducibility Initiative to leverage our online network of service providers to validate public studies, and publish the reproduced results in open access journals. We have received support from nonprofits such as the Arnold Foundation to pursue these goals.","Federal open data, Private/proprietary data sources",Eagle-i,https://www.eagle-i.net/,,2
