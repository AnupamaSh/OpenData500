	<h2>Study Objectives</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Foster a dialogue between government and business on how government data can be made more useful</li>
		<li>Provide a basis for assessing the social and economic value of government open data</li>
		<li>Encourage the development of open data companies</li>
	</ul>

<section id="about-govlab-approach">
	<h2>Approach</h2>
	<p>The Italian Open Data 100 project is a study of Italian companies that use open government data in their business activities. The project is being undertaken in collaboration between the GovLab, a team of researchers at New York University, and researchers from the Digital Commons Lab at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (Trento, Italy) with the support of expert advisors. The Govlab will also host in the first stage of the study, a visiting fellow from FBK. This collaboration will produce a landmark study of the Italian experience and the results will be a valuable resource for policymakers.</p>

		<h2 class="m-page-title">Company Identification</h2>
		<p>The Open Data 100 Italy team will compile the list of companies through (1) outreach campaigns, (2) advice from experts and professional organizations, and (3) additional research. The results of the study will culminate in an online platform at www.opendata500.com/it, which will highlight the companies and their use of open government data in Italy.</p>

	<section id="about-what-study-is-not" class="m-half">
		<h2 class="m-page-title">What The Study Is Not</h2>
		<p>The Open Data 100 Italy a is not a rating or ranking of companies. It covers companies of different sizes and categories, using various kinds of data. The Open Data 100 Italy is not a competition, but an attempt to give a broad, inclusive view of the field. The study also does not provide a random sample for definitive statistical analysis. Since this is the first thorough scan of companies in the field, it is not yet possible to determine the exact landscape of open data companies.</p>
