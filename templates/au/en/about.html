<h1 class="first-title">About the Open Data 100 Australia</h1>

<section class="intro">
	<p>The Open Data 100 Australia is part of the Commonwealth of Australia's Open Data initiative, and is the first comprehensive study of Mexican companies and NGOs that use open government data to generate new business, develop new products and services or create social value. Open Data is free, public data that can be used, reused and redistributed to launch commercial and nonprofit ventures, conduct research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems.</p>
</section>

<section id="about-goals">
	<h2>Study Objectives</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Provide a basis for assessing the economic value of government open data
		<li>Encourage the development of new open data companies</li>
		<li>Foster a dialogue between government and business on how government data can be made for useful</li>
	</ul>
</section>

		<h2 class="m-page-title">Company Identification</h2>
		<p>The Open Data 100 Australia team will compile the list of companies and NGO's through (1) outreach campaigns, (2) advice from experts and professional organizations, and (3) additional research.
The results of the study will culminate in an online platform at www.opendata500.com/au, which will highlight the companies and their use of open government data in Australia.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="about-what-study-is-not" class="m-half">
		<h2 class="m-page-title">What The Study Is Not</h2>
		<p>The Open Data 100 Australia is not a rating or ranking of companies. It covers companies of different sizes and categories, using various kinds of data. The Open Data 100 Australia is not a competition, but an attempt to give a broad, inclusive view of the field. The study also does not provide a random sample for definitive statistical analysis. Since this is the first thorough scan of companies in the field, it is not yet possible to determine the exact landscape of open data companies.</p>
