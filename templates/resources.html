		<p>The Governance Lab (The GovLab) at New York University strives to improve people’s lives by changing how we govern. We endeavor to strengthen the ability of people and institutions to work together to solve problems, make decisions, resolve conflict and govern themselves more effectively and legitimately. We design technology, policy and strategies for fostering more open and collaborative approaches to governance and we test what works. Founded in 2012, with funding from the MacArthur and Knight Foundations, The GovLab brings together thinkers and doers who design, implement, and study technology-enabled solutions that advance a collaborative, networked approached to reinvent institutions of governance.</p>
