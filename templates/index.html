<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p>The Open Data 500 is the first comprehensive study of U.S. companies that use open government data to generate new business and develop new products and services. The Open Data 500 study is funded by the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Knight Foundation</a> and conducted by <a href="http://thegovlab.org/" target="_blank">the GovLab</a>. Open data is free, public data that anyone can use to launch commercial and nonprofit ventures, do research, make data-driven decisions, and solve complex problems. </p>
